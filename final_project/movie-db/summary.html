<h1> Final Project Summary<hr></h1>
<h2 class="text"> Topic </h2>
<p class="text"> The topic of my project is a movie search engine that also allows a user to add, edit, delete, and review movies. If a user isn't logged in, they won't have access to any editing, deleting, adding, or reviewing privileges. They can still search, and view details on movies. There are no admin accounts, but anyone and everyone can create an account. The data is coming from our dvd database that we worked with in class, and I have a separate user review database that holds users and their reviews that correspond to different movies as well that hold the id's of the actual movies in the dvd database.</p>
